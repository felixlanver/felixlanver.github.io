  <h1>My Data Posts</h1>

<div class="intro-wrap">
  <p class="intro">
    Welcome to my website! I'm a political scientist and doctoral researcher working at the intersection of data and public policy.
    Most of my research focuses on quantitative analysis, looking at welfare states and labor markets.
    Over time, I‚Äôve realized that the way we present data matters just as much as the data itself.<br><br>

    This page collects my ongoing experiments in data visualization: from scatterplots to pie charts, between font size and color choices, static to interactive.
    While I usually work in R, all the charts here are made in Python as part of my effort to deepen my skills and explore new workflows.
    It‚Äôs as much a design project as it is a learning journey.<br><br>

    Some posts are explanatory, others more playful or reflective.
    I'm still figuring out what style fits best, and I genuinely welcome your feedback.
    I hope to transition into professional data visualization and analysis after my PhD, so this also serves as a living portfolio.

    <div class="desc">
      What‚Äôs the biggest city in the world?<br>
      This chart compares the population of the top 10 cities by three definitions: City Proper, Urban Area, and Metropolitan Area.
    </div>

    <img src="city_pop.jpg" alt="City Population">

    <div class="desc">
      City Proper refers to the population within official administrative boundaries. <br>
      This can include vast rural areas, especially in large jurisdictions like Chongqing, China, <br>
      where over 70% of the population may live in non-urban settings.<br>
      Urban Area focuses on the contiguous built-up environment, disregarding administrative borders. <br>
      It offers a more consistent picture of physical city size but varies by national criteria.<br>
      Metropolitan Area includes both the urban core and its surrounding commuter belt, <br>
      defined by economic and infrastructural ties.<br>
      It best reflects a city's functional reach but may vary based on statistical definitions and governance models.

      But regions like the Byzantine Empire (Syria), Africa Proconsularis (Tunisia), and the Holy Land (Israel/Palestine) also produced popes ‚Äî especially in the early centuries.
